    "Matrices are the shorthand description of Transformations, but sometimes it isn't easy (possible even) to determine what a particular matrix might do to the vectors that lie in the same space. Fortunately there can be certain vectors that a Transformation only stretches or contracts by a scalar multiple. These are known as Eigen Vectors, and the scalar multiples are the Eigen Values. Another useful application of Eigen stuff is to create diagonalized forms of a matrix enabling exponentiation to be carried out at lightspeed even compared with the calculations necessary for low powers (A^4 A\\*A\\*A\\*A)\n",
